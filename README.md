## üí° About the Project

[cite_start]This system performs **real-time face detection** by accessing the computer's webcam to capture live video frames[cite: 52, 59]. [cite_start]It applies a pre-trained **Haar Cascade Classifier** to identify and localize human faces[cite: 53, 60, 99]. [cite_start]The program was developed by **Abdul Rehan** for the Machine Learning subject at **Rai Technology University**[cite: 7, 10, 16].

## ‚ú® Key Features

* [cite_start]**Real-time Video Processing:** Captures and processes live video input continuously using the webcam[cite: 59, 63].
* [cite_start]**Efficient Detection:** Converts each frame to **grayscale** to improve processing speed and efficiency for detection[cite: 54, 64, 94].
* [cite_start]**Classical Technique:** Employs the fast and lightweight **Haar Cascade Classifier** (based on the Viola-Jones technique)[cite: 53, 99, 136, 195].
* [cite_start]**Visualization:** Highlights detected faces with **green rectangular bounding boxes**[cite: 54, 60, 66, 111, 187].
* [cite_start]**Graceful Exit:** The system provides an option to exit the program by pressing the **'s' key**[cite: 56, 61, 67, 114].

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Methodology)

[cite_start]The system follows a structured approach for real-time processing[cite: 86]:

1.  [cite_start]**Data Acquisition:** Initializes the webcam using `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` to obtain a continuous stream of video frames[cite: 89, 90, 92].
2.  [cite_start]**Pre-processing:** Converts the captured video frame from RGB to grayscale using `cv2.cvtColor()` to reduce complexity and speed up detection[cite: 94, 96, 97].
3.  [cite_start]**Face Detection:** Loads the pre-trained `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` model and uses `detectMultiScale()` to scan the grayscale frame for faces[cite: 99, 105, 164, 172].
4.  [cite_start]**Visualization:** Draws rectangles around the coordinates of detected faces and displays the output using `cv2.imshow("live_action", video_data)`[cite: 111, 115, 180, 181].
